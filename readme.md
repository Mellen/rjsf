# Reactive Javascript Framework

RJSF for short.

## What! Why?

I know. There are other, better frameworks out there. We don't need any more. I agree.

This is not about making a framework to replace Vue.js or anything like that. It's about creating something to learn how it could be created.

Javascript frameworks often seem to me like incredible works, and they are, and making anything similar, despite being a waste of time, is something I couldn't do. But, well, I could. I not a bad programmer, I can figure these things out. So I will.

(N.B. fill out the readme more when I make examples.)
